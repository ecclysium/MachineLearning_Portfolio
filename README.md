# MachineLearning_Portfolio
A portfolio for work done relating to Machine Learning. 

## Assignment 1- Machine Learning Overview and Definitions
An assignment talking about definitons in Machine Learning, important points, and examples. I also talk briefly about what I would like to learn in ML. A link to the pdf can be found [here.](OverviewOfML.pdf)

## Assignment 2- Machine Learning Data Exploration
A document talking about statistics between two vectors, and a C++ code file demonstrating some of them to match. A link to the pdf can be found [here.](DataExploration/MLDataExploration.pdf) The C++ code can be found [here.](DataExploration/main.cpp)

## Assignment 3- Linear Models 
Now we're getting our hands *R*-eally dirty. A document discussing linear regression in many different forms can be found [here,](LinearModels/Regression.pdf) and a document detailing logistic regression and Naive Bayes for classification can be found [here.](LinearModels/Classification.pdf) In collaboration with Zachary Canoot.

## Assignment 4 - Machine Learning From Scratch
Naive Bayes and Logistic Regression coded from scratch in C++. A document discussion what we learned from studying the same data from different algorithms with different attributes can be found [here.](FromScratch/MachineLearningClassificationFromScratch.pdf) Code for Naive Bayes can be found [here,](FromScratch/NaiveBayes.cpp) and Logistic Regression can be found [here.](FromScratch/LogisticRegressionModel.cpp)

##Assignment 5 - Similarities
A document talking about various ways that algorithms that look for similarities between data points can be [found here.](Similarities/Similarities.pdf) A document on regression can be found [here,](Similarities/Regression.pdf) on classification can be found [here,](Similarities/Classification.pdf) clustering can be found [here,](Similarities/Clustering.pdf), and dimension reduction can be found [here,](Similarities/Dimensionality.pdf).
