# MachineLearning_Portfolio
A portfolio for work done relating to Machine Learning. 

## Assignment 1- Machine Learning Overview and Definitions
An assignment talking about definitons in Machine Learning, important points, and examples. I also talk briefly about what I would like to learn in ML. A link to the pdf can be found [here.](OverviewOfML.pdf)

## Assignment 2- Machine Learning Data Exploration
A document talking about statistics between two vectors, and a C++ code file demonstrating some of them to match. A link to the pdf can be found [here.](DataExploration/MLDataExploration.pdf) The C++ code can be found [here.](DataExploration/main.cpp)

## Assignment 3- Linear Models
Now we're getting our hands *R*-eally dirty. A document discussing linear regression in many different forms can be found [here,](LinearModels/Regression.pdf) and a document detailing logistic regression and Naive Bayes for classification can be found [here.](LinearModels/Classification.pdf)
